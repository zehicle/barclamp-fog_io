  # Requires allows you to declare that this barclamp relies on
  # another barclamp to provide some of its functionality.
  # All barclamps implicitly rely on the crowbar barclamp.

  # Member allows you to declare that this barclamp is a member
  # of a group of related barclamp.  A barclamp can be a member of 
  # muliple groups, and a group name can be used instead of a barclamp
  # in a requires: clause by prefixing it with an @ sign.

# gems allows you to declare the gems you need.
# Unlike the other package types, you can ask for a specific version of a gem
# The build system will solve dependencies as best it can, but if a gem you have 
# requires extra packages to install you will need to add them to the appropriate
# build_pkgs section of rpms and debs above.
